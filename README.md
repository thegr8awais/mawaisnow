> _M Awais did an AMAZING JOB on my portal. He did beyond what I could have ever imagined for this project. He is very good at what he does!!! He was so patient and understanding with the change requests. I couldn't have asked for a better developer. He worked long hours to meet a pretty aggressive deadline. He was always available for questions and feedback on changes and provided updates. I can't brag enough about him. He really made my vision come to life! Thank you! I would highly recommend him for any project. Looking forward to working with him again in the future._
